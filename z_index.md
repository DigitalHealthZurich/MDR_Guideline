# Welcome to the Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) Guideline

The [Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745) sets the regulatory framework for placing medical devices on the EU market. This guide provides an overview of the key steps for compliance, outlining the main requirements and processes involved. It supports manufacturers, regulators, and stakeholders in understanding these requirements to ensure the safety and performance of medical devices.

The following key steps outline the regulatory process:
- **Device Qualification & Classification:** Determine whether the product qualifies as a medical device and classify it based on risk, duration, and invasiveness according to the MDR classification rules.

- **Intended Purpose & General Product Description:** Clearly define the intended use and device characteristics, as these play a crucial role in regulatory compliance and conformity assessment.

- **Technical Documentation:** Prepare comprehensive documentation, including device specifications, general safety and performance requirements, risk management analysis, manufacturing information, and validation data. These documents support the conformity assessment process.

- **Conformity Assessment:** Select the appropriate assessment pathway based on the device classification. Low-risk devices may be self-certified, while higher-risk devices require assessment by a Notified Body.

- **Clinical Evaluation:** Provide evidence of safety and performance, either through clinical investigations or existing clinical data. The level of clinical evidence required depends on the classification and nature of the device.

- **Processes & Quality Management System (QMS):** Implement a quality management system in accordance with ISO 13485. Establish risk management procedures, post-market surveillance, and clinical follow-up measures to ensure ongoing compliance.

- **UDI & EUDAMED Registration:** Assign a Unique Device Identifier (UDI) and register the device in the EUDAMED database to ensure traceability and regulatory transparency.

- **Market Placement & Ongoing Compliance:** Finalize the declaration of conformity, apply the CE mark, and maintain post-market surveillance activities. Report incidents and necessary changes to authorities as required.
