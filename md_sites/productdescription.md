## General Requirements
A comprehensive and accurate product description is a fundamental requirement under MDR Annex II (Technical Documentation) and MDR Annex XIV (Clinical Evaluation Plan). It serves as the foundation for Classification (Annex VIII), Conformity Assessment (Annex IX–XI), and post-market obligations.

The product description should:
- Provide a clear overview of the medical device, its function, intended use, and technological characteristics.
- Be consistent across all documentation and updated throughout the device lifecycle.


### **MDR Annex II, Section 1.1(a) Requires:**
- A detailed description of the device, including its intended use and classification rationale.
- Information on materials, design principles, and operational modes.
- A comparison to similar devices, if applicable.

### **MDR Annex XIV, Part A, Section 1(d) Requires:**
- A detailed description of the device under evaluation, including its intended application and use.
- Identification of target patient groups, indications, and contraindications.

A well-structured product description ensures alignment across regulatory documentation, clinical evaluation, and risk management.

## Comparable Devices & Equivalence Justification

If claiming equivalence under **MDR Annex XIV, Part A, Section 3**, manufacturers must provide a structured comparative analysis of similar products on the market.

### **Comparison Criteria (Annex XIV, Part A, Section 3):**
- Same intended purpose and clinical application.
- Comparable technological characteristics (design, materials, function).
- Equivalent biological interaction (biocompatibility, safety profile).

**Equivalence Justification Implications:**
- If equivalence is demonstrated, existing clinical data may be used to support conformity.
- If differences exist, additional clinical investigations may be required.
- Higher-risk devices may require notified body involvement for equivalence validation.

Supporting evidence should also be documented in the **Clinical Evaluation Report and Technical Documentation (Annex II).**

## Novel Features & Innovation

MDR Annex II, Section 1.1(b), "Device description and specification, including variants and accessories," requires manufacturers to document any novel technological aspects that may influence device safety, performance, or regulatory requirements. 

If the device includes novel design aspects, new materials, or innovative technologies, manufacturers must provide a clear description, including:
- Key technological advancements distinguishing the device from existing alternatives.
- New materials, software functionalities, or AI-based components.
- Potential impact on safety and performance.

### Documentation Requirements Under MDR Annex II, Section 1.1(b)
Note: In addition to describing novel features, manufacturers must provide supporting documentation demonstrating compliance with safety and performance standards. This includes:
- Scientific evidence justifying new features.
- Risk-benefit analysis in accordance with MDR Annex I – General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR).
- ISO 14971-compliant risk assessments.

Devices incorporating machine learning, nanotechnology, or novel biomaterials may require additional safety validation and risk assessments. These should be referenced in the risk management file (ISO 14971) and clinical evaluation report (Annex XIV).

## Consistency Across Documentation & Compliance

The product description must align with all regulatory documentation, ensuring consistency across:

- **Instructions for Use (IFU)** (*Annex I, Section 23*)
- **Labeling Requirements** (*Annex I, Section 23.4*)
- **Risk Management File (ISO 14971)**
- **Post-Market Surveillance Reports** (*Annex III, Section 1*)

Maintaining a clear and consistent product description across all documentation helps avoid regulatory scrutiny, notified body rejections, or unnecessary revisions.
