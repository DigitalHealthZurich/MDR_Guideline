# Product Description

## General Requirements
A comprehensive and accurate product description is a fundamental requirement under **MDR Annex II**. It serves as the foundation for **classification (Annex VIII)**, **conformity assessment (Annex IX–XI)**, and the overall **technical documentation**.

The product description should:
- Provide a **clear overview** of the medical device, its **function, intended use, and technological characteristics**.
- Be **consistent across all documentation** and updated throughout the device lifecycle.

### **MDR Annex II, Section 1.1(a) Requires:**
- A **detailed device description**, including intended purpose and classification rationale.
- A **comparison to similar devices**, if applicable.
- A **summary of novel features** distinguishing it from existing technologies.

---

## Generic Device Group & Regulatory Classification
Devices must be categorized into a **Generic Device Group** based on intended use and technological characteristics, aligning with:
- **European Medical Device Nomenclature (EMDN)**
- **CND/EMDN 1681 codes**
- **MDR Annex VIII classification rules**

Manufacturers should verify whether additional guidance, such as **MDCG 2021-24 (Guidance on Classification of Medical Devices)**, applies to their product.

## Comparable Devices & Equivalence Justification
If applicable, manufacturers should provide a **comparative analysis** of similar products already on the market. This is especially important for devices claiming **equivalence in clinical evaluation (Annex XIV, Part A, Section 3)**.

The comparison should highlight:
- **Similarities** in design, intended use, and technical specifications.
- **Differences** that may affect safety, performance, or usability.
- **Compliance** with relevant harmonized standards (*e.g., IEC 60601 for electrical safety, ISO 10993 for biocompatibility*).

### **Impact on Classification and Clinical Data**
- **Equivalence justification** can affect the required **clinical data for conformity assessment**.
- If a product shares risk factors with higher-risk devices, it may impact **classification (Annex VIII)**.

## Novel Features & Innovation
A key component of the product description is identifying any **novel or innovative aspects** of the device.

### **MDR Annex II, Section 1.1(b) Requires Documentation Of:**
- **Technological advancements** distinguishing the device from previous iterations.
- **Unique design features** that may impact safety and performance.
- **New materials or software functionalities**, especially if they introduce new risk factors (*e.g., AI-based decision support, nanomaterials*).

### **Supporting Evidence**
Any novel features should be supported by:
- **Scientific evidence and technical justifications** (*MDR Annex XIV – Clinical Evaluation*).
- **Risk-benefit assessments**, as required by **ISO 14971** and **MDR Annex I – General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR)**.

## Consistency Across Documentation & Compliance
The product description must be aligned with all other regulatory documents, including:
- **Instructions for Use** (*Annex I, Section 23*)
- **Labeling requirements** (*Annex I, Section 23.4*)
- **Risk management documentation** (*ISO 14971*)
- **Post-market surveillance reports** (*Annex III, Section 1*)

Ensuring precise, legally compliant wording helps avoid inconsistencies that could lead to **regulatory scrutiny, rejection, or extensive revisions**.
