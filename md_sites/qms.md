# Quality Management System (QMS) Under MDR 2017/745

A **Quality Management System (QMS)** is a **mandatory requirement** under **MDR Article 10(9)** for all medical device manufacturers. It ensures **regulatory compliance**, product **safety**, and **consistent quality** throughout the device lifecycle. While **ISO 13485** is not explicitly required, it is the recognized international standard for medical device QMS and strongly recommended for MDR compliance.

This section provides an overview of the **QMS requirements** under MDR, key implementation steps, and the link to regulatory conformity assessments.

## Regulatory Basis for QMS

### **MDR Requirements (Article 10(9))**
Manufacturers must establish, document, implement, maintain, update, and **continuously improve** a QMS that ensures compliance with MDR. The QMS must cover:

- **Regulatory compliance & documentation control** (ensuring alignment with MDR, Annex I - General Safety and Performance Requirements).
- **Risk management processes** (integrated with **ISO 14971**).
- **Design & development controls** (ensuring product safety from concept to final design).
- **Supplier & subcontractor management** (ensuring compliance of external partners).
- **Manufacturing & process validation** (ensuring product consistency & reliability).
- **Post-market surveillance (PMS) & vigilance** (aligning with MDR Annex III).
- **UDI and traceability requirements** (ensuring regulatory identification of devices).
- **Corrective & preventive action (CAPA) processes** (continuous improvement & compliance).

### **ISO 13485: The Standard for Medical Device QMS**
ISO 13485 is the **internationally accepted standard** for medical device QMS. It provides a structured framework for manufacturers to implement processes that align with MDR requirements. **While not legally required, ISO 13485 certification simplifies MDR conformity and notified body audits.**

## Key Components of a Compliant QMS

A **fully compliant QMS** must integrate **all critical regulatory processes**, ensuring device safety and regulatory compliance throughout the lifecycle.

1. **Regulatory Compliance & Documentation Control**
   - Maintain controlled documentation aligning with MDR.
   - Ensure traceability and version control for all technical documentation.

2. **Risk Management Integration (ISO 14971)**
   - Implement **risk-based decision-making** across all QMS processes.
   - Ensure ongoing risk assessment, verification, and validation.

3. **Manufacturing & Process Control**
   - Validate all production processes to ensure consistency.
   - Implement quality control measures at all manufacturing stages.

4. **Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) & Vigilance**
   - Establish **a PMS system** (as required under MDR Annex III).
   - Monitor post-market safety and device performance.
   - Implement **Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF)** when necessary.

5. **Supplier & Subcontractor Management**
   - Conduct **supplier qualification** and **regular audits**.
   - Ensure external suppliers and subcontractors comply with MDR.

6. **UDI & Traceability**
   - Implement **Unique Device Identification (UDI)** for full product traceability.
   - Maintain distribution records for **market surveillance and recalls**.

7. **Internal Audits & Continuous Improvement**
   - Conduct **regular internal audits** to ensure compliance.
   - Implement **Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)** to address issues.

## Implementing a QMS Under MDR

**Step-by-Step Guide to Establishing a QMS:**
1. **Develop QMS documentation** (Quality Manual, SOPs, work instructions).
2. **Define regulatory responsibilities** within the organization.
3. **Implement document control & record-keeping procedures.**
4. **Establish risk-based quality processes** (aligned with ISO 14971).
5. **Ensure supplier compliance & implement supplier agreements.**
6. **Set up post-market surveillance & complaint handling procedures.**
7. **Prepare for audits & certification (if required for device class).**

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Manufacturers of **Class IIa, IIb, and III devices** must have their **QMS assessed by a Notified Body** before obtaining MDR certification.

## Post-Market Surveillance under QMS

Under MDR Annex III and ISO 13485:2016 Clause 8, manufacturers must ensure that post-market surveillance (PMS) is fully integrated into their quality management system (QMS). PMS is not a separate process but a core part of ensuring medical device safety and performance over time.  

PMS findings must be systematically linked to key QMS elements:  
- **Risk Management (ISO 14971):** PMS data must be evaluated to update risk management files.  
- **Corrective and Preventive Actions:** Identified risks or failures in PMS reports should trigger Corrective and Preventive Actions activities.  
- **Design & Manufacturing Adjustments:** PMS results should inform improvements in device design and manufacturing processes.  
- **Regulatory Reporting Compliance:** QMS ensures proper documentation and regulatory reporting of PMS findings, including:  
  - Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSUR)  
  - Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF)  
  - Vigilance reporting (serious incidents, field safety corrective actions)  

### Compliance Expectations in Audits 

Notified bodies assess whether PMS is properly embedded in the QMS. Common issues include:  
- PMS data is collected but not linked to risk management or CAPA.  
- Reports exist but do not result in measurable product improvements.  
- PMS processes operate passively instead of being actively reviewed and acted upon.  

To ensure compliance, manufacturers must:  
- Demonstrate how PMS findings influence QMS processes.  
- Maintain full traceability between PMS results, risk updates, and design modifications.  
- Ensure PMS activities drive continuous improvements and regulatory compliance.

## Notified Body Audits & Certification

For **Class IIa, IIb, and III devices**, a **Notified Body (NB) audit** of the QMS is mandatory to obtain CE marking.

- **Audit Scope:**
  - Verification of QMS compliance with **MDR Annex IX**.
  - Review of **risk management**, **design control**, **manufacturing validation**, and **post-market surveillance**.
  - **Inspection of supplier controls and CAPA system**.

- **ISO 13485 Certification:**
  - Although **not legally required**, ISO 13485 certification simplifies notified body audits.
  - Reduces the risk of **non-conformities** during MDR compliance checks.

## Common Challenges & Best Practices

**Challenges Manufacturers Face:**
- **Lack of QMS integration with risk management & PMS** â†’ *Ensure MDR compliance by linking all QMS processes*.
- **Inefficient document control** â†’ *Implement structured version control & training*.
- **Supplier management gaps** â†’ *Regular audits & quality agreements are critical*.
- **Audit readiness** â†’ *Manufacturers often fail audits due to missing traceability or inadequate risk management*.

**Best Practices for Compliance:**
- **Use a modular documentation system** (STED format is recommended).
- **Train personnel on QMS compliance** and **audit expectations**.
- **Conduct internal audits before Notified Body reviews.**
- **Keep QMS updated** with new MDR & ISO requirements.
