title: Conformity Declaration and CE Marking (MDR Annex IX, X, XI)

# Conformity Declaration and CE Marking under MDR

To legally place a medical device on the European market, manufacturers must complete a conformity assessment and issue an EU Declaration of Conformity in accordance with MDR 2017/745. The final step in this process is obtaining the CE marking, which signifies compliance with all applicable requirements.

The conformity assessment procedure varies based on the device classification and must follow the appropriate route outlined in Annex IX, X, or XI of the MDR.

## Regulatory Basis for Conformity Declaration

Article 19 and Annex IV of the MDR set out the requirements for issuing an EU Declaration of Conformity. This document is a legally binding statement in which the manufacturer declares that the medical device complies with all applicable MDR provisions.

The conformity assessment must follow one of the procedures defined in:

- **Annex IX**: Conformity assessment based on a quality management system and assessment of technical documentation.
- **Annex X**: Conformity assessment based on type examination.
- **Annex XI**: Conformity assessment based on product conformity verification.

For Class I devices, manufacturers can issue an EU Declaration of Conformity without involving a Notified Body, except for devices that are sterile, have a measuring function, or are reusable surgical instruments, which require Notified Body involvement.

For higher-risk devices (Class IIa, IIb, III), a Notified Body must be involved in the conformity assessment.

## Routes for Conformity Assessment

Manufacturers must select the appropriate conformity assessment procedure based on device classification and intended use.

### **1. Annex IX – Full Quality Assurance**
- The manufacturer implements a quality management system (QMS) that covers design, production, and post-market surveillance.
- A Notified Body audits the QMS and assesses technical documentation.
- Applicable to Class IIa, IIb, and III devices.

### **2. Annex X – Type Examination**
- A Notified Body examines a representative sample of the device design.
- The manufacturer must ensure that all devices produced conform to the approved type.
- Typically used in conjunction with Annex XI for certain Class IIb and III devices.

### **3. Annex XI – Product Conformity Verification**
- **Part A – Production Quality Assurance**: The manufacturer implements a QMS focused on manufacturing and final inspection; a Notified Body assesses the system.
- **Part B – Product Verification**: Each device or batch undergoes individual examination by a Notified Body.
- Applicable to Class IIb and III devices.

Class I devices not requiring Notified Body involvement can proceed directly to the EU Declaration of Conformity and CE marking.

## EU Declaration of Conformity (DoC)

The EU Declaration of Conformity is a legally binding document in which the manufacturer affirms that the device meets all MDR requirements. It must include:

- **Manufacturer information**: Name, address, and, if applicable, details of the authorized representative.
- **Product identification**: Basic UDI-DI, product name, model, or catalog number.
- **Conformity assessment procedure followed**: Reference to the applicable Annex (IX, X, XI).
- **Applicable Union legislation**: Declaration of conformity with MDR and any other relevant Union legislation.
- **Notified Body details**: Name and identification number, if involved.
- **Place and date of issue**, along with the signature of the authorized person.

The **EU Declaration of Conformity must be kept for at least 10 years** after the last device is placed on the market (15 years for implantable devices).

## CE Marking and Market Access

Once the EU Declaration of Conformity is issued, the manufacturer can affix the CE mark to the device, allowing it to be sold in the European Economic Area (EEA).

### **Key CE Marking Requirements:**
- The CE mark must be visible, legible, and indelible on the device, packaging, or accompanying documents.
- If a Notified Body was involved, its four-digit identification number must be placed alongside the CE mark.
- The manufacturer must ensure continued compliance with MDR through post-market surveillance and vigilance reporting.

The CE marking signifies that the device complies with:
- The **General Safety and Performance Requirements** in MDR Annex I.
- The relevant **conformity assessment procedure**.
- The obligations related to **post-market surveillance and risk management**.
