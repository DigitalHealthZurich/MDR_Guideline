# Provide Clinical Evaluation under MDR Annex XIV

The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 requires manufacturers to assess the safety, performance, and clinical benefits of their devices through clinical evaluation. This process involves systematically collecting and analyzing clinical data from various sources, including clinical investigations, literature reviews, and post-market clinical follow-up. 

This page focuses on how to evaluate clinical data, ensuring compliance with MDR Annex XIV. For an overview of clinical evaluation and its regulatory framework, refer to the [main Clinical Evaluation page](https://digitalhealthzurich.github.io/MDR_Guideline/md_sites/clinical_evaluation.html).

## Sources of Clinical Data

Clinical data can be obtained from multiple sources, including:

### Clinical Investigations
- Required for novel or high-risk devices where existing clinical evidence is insufficient.
- Must comply with ISO 14155 for Good Clinical Practice in medical device studies.
- Provides new, device-specific clinical evidence.

### Literature Reviews
- Systematic assessment of published clinical studies on the same or equivalent devices.
- Scientific validity and relevance to the device must be justified.

### Real-World Data
- Clinical data from registries, hospital records, and post-market surveillance reports.
- Supports long-term safety and effectiveness monitoring.

### Equivalent Device Data
- Can be used if equivalence is demonstrated based on the same intended use, technological characteristics, and biological interaction.
- Justification must be provided with objective evidence, and full access to technical documentation is required.

## Criteria for Evaluating Clinical Data

Clinical data must be assessed based on scientific validity, relevance, and quality. MDR Annex XIV requires that:

- Clinical investigations comply with ISO 14155 and ethical principles.
- Data is statistically significant and free from bias.
- Study populations reflect the intended patient group.
- Adverse events and long-term outcomes are fully documented.

The benefit-risk analysis must also demonstrate that the device's benefits outweigh any residual risks.

## Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up

Post-market clinical follow-up is required under MDR Annex XIV, Part B, to ensure continued safety and performance after market approval.

### Objectives:
- Identify previously unknown risks or rare complications.
- Confirm the long-term performance and benefits of the device.
- Detect off-label use and new clinical indications.

### Methods:
- Post-market clinical investigations.
- Registry studies and patient surveys.
- Analysis of complaints, vigilance reports, and real-world data.

Findings from post-market clinical follow-up must be used to update clinical evaluation and risk management documentation.

## How Clinical Data Supports the Clinical Evaluation Report

All clinical data must be compiled into the clinical evaluation report, which:
- Summarizes all clinical data sources and their relevance.
- Demonstrates compliance with the General Safety and Performance Requirements in Annex I.
- Justifies whether additional post-market clinical follow-up activities are required.
- Links clinical findings to risk management and post-market surveillance data.

Notified bodies assess the completeness, consistency, and validity of the clinical evaluation report as part of conformity assessments, particularly for high-risk devices.
