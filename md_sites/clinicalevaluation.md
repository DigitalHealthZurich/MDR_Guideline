# Clinical Evaluation under MDR Annex XIV

The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 mandates that manufacturers conduct a clinical evaluation to demonstrate the safety, performance, and clinical benefits of their devices. This evaluation is an ongoing process that must be maintained throughout the device’s lifecycle.

Clinical evaluation is required for all medical devices, regardless of their classification, and is a key element of the conformity assessment process. It is closely linked to risk management, post-market surveillance (PMS), and technical documentation.

## Regulatory Basis for Clinical Evaluation

Clinical evaluation is governed by **Article 61 of MDR 2017/745** and **Annex XIV, Part A**. These sections outline the legal requirements for manufacturers to generate and assess clinical data.

### **MDR Annex XIV, Part A – Clinical Evaluation Requirements**
The clinical evaluation must be based on a clinical evaluation pla* and must include:

1. A **systematic and planned process** of collecting, assessing, and analyzing clinical data.
2. Demonstration of **conformity with the General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR) of Annex I**.
3. Consideration of **available preclinical and clinical data**.
4. A **risk-benefit determination** for the device.
5. A plan for **post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF)** where necessary.

The results of the clinical evaluation must be documented in a Clinical Evaluation Report, which forms part of the device’s technical documentation.

## Objectives of Clinical Evaluation

The primary objectives of a clinical evaluation are:

- To confirm that the **device performs as intended** and provides the claimed **clinical benefits**.
- To ensure that the **device is safe** and its risks are outweighed by its benefits.
- To support the **conformity assessment process** required for CE marking.
- To continuously update clinical evidence through **post-market surveillance (PMS) and PMCF**.

Clinical evaluation is a continuous process that extends beyond the initial certification of the device. Manufacturers must update their evaluation when new clinical data becomes available.

## Key Elements of Clinical Evaluation

Clinical evaluation consists of several critical components:

### **1. Clinical Evaluation Plan**
The **clinical evaluation plan** defines the methodology, scope, and criteria for conducting a clinical evaluation. It includes:
- Identification of relevant clinical data sources.
- Criteria for assessing clinical benefit and risk.
- Justification for equivalence claims (if applicable).

[Detailed discussion available on the Clinical Evaluation Plan subpage](clinical_evaluation_plan.md).

### **2. Provide Non-Clinical Evaluation**
Manufacturers must assess non-clinical data, such as:
- Preclinical testing (e.g., bench tests, biocompatibility studies).
- Literature reviews on existing clinical knowledge.
- Justification of safety and performance without direct clinical investigations.

[More details in the Non-Clinical Evaluation subpage](non_clinical_evaluation.md).

### **3. Provide Clinical Evaluation**
Manufacturers must analyze clinical data, which can come from:
- **Clinical investigations** (if required by MDR Article 62).
- **Existing clinical studies** and real-world evidence.
- **Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF)**.

## Integration with Other Regulatory Requirements

### **1. Risk Management (ISO 14971)**
Clinical evaluation is closely linked to risk management. The residual risks of a device must be justified based on clinical evidence, and any new risks identified through clinical evaluation must be fed back into the risk management process.

### **2. Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) & PMCF**
Manufacturers must continuously monitor clinical performance through PMS and PMCF under MDR Annex III. If new safety concerns arise, the clinical evaluation must be updated.

### **3. Technical Documentation (Annex II & III)**
The *Clinical Evaluation Report is part of the technical documentation required for regulatory approval. It must be aligned with:
- The **General Safety and Performance Requirements (Annex I)**.
- The **Post-Market Surveillance Plan (Annex III)**.
