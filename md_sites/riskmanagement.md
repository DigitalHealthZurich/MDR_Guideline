# Risk Management – ISO 14971 & MDR Compliance

Risk management is a fundamental requirement under MDR 2017/745 and must be applied throughout the entire lifecycle of a medical device. ISO 14971:2019 provides the internationally recognized standard for implementing a structured risk management to ensure regulatory compliance and device safety.

This section outlines key risk management obligations, implementation steps, and best practices.

## Regulatory Basis for Risk Management

### MDR 2017/745 – Risk Management Requirements
MDR mandates that manufacturers establish, document, and maintain a risk management as part of their quality management system. Risk management must be applied from design through post-market surveillance.

Key MDR references:
- **Article 10(2)**: Manufacturers must implement a structured risk management.
- **Annex I, Chapter I (General Safety & Performance Requirements - GSPR)**:
  - Risk management must ensure an acceptable risk-benefit ratio.
  - Risk reduction measures must follow a clear priority:
    1. Inherently safe design  
    2. Protective measures (e.g., alarms, barriers)  
    3. Information for safety (warnings, IFU)

## Core Elements of an MDR-Compliant RMS

A compliant risk management must integrate all critical risk-related processes, ensuring device safety and regulatory compliance.

1. **Risk Management Plan**
   - Defines scope, responsibilities, and risk acceptance criteria.
   - Establishes links between design, risk, and post-market processes.

2. **Risk Analysis**
   - Identifies hazards, hazardous situations, and foreseeable misuse.
   - Applies risk analysis techniques such as Failure Modes & Effects Analysis (FMEA).

3. **Risk Evaluation**
   - Assesses risk levels based on probability and severity.
   - Determines whether risk reduction measures are required.

4. **Risk Control**
   - Implements measures to reduce risks to an acceptable level.
   - Prioritizes risk controls in the following order:
     1. Inherently safe design  
     2. Protective measures (alarms, barriers, shields)  
     3. Information for safety (warnings, training, IFU)  

5. **Residual Risk & Benefit-Risk Analysis**
   - Evaluates remaining risks after applying all control measures.
   - Justifies that the device’s benefits outweigh the remaining risks.

6. **Risk Management Report**
   - Documents all risk management activities, including residual risks.
   - Demonstrates compliance with regulatory expectations.

## Implementation of ISO 14971

ISO 14971:2019 is the international risk management standard for medical devices, aligning with MDR requirements.

### Key Steps in Applying ISO 14971
1. Establish a risk management framework  
   - Define policies, scope, and responsibilities.
2. Conduct risk analysis  
   - Identify hazards and estimate potential risks.
3. Perform risk evaluation  
   - Use severity/probability matrices to assess impact.
4. Implement risk controls  
   - Apply safety measures to reduce risks to acceptable levels.
5. Evaluate residual risk & conduct benefit-risk analysis  
   - Assess whether remaining risks are justified by device benefits.
6. Monitor risks post-market  
   - Update risk assessments based on real-world data.

## Risk-Benefit Analysis & Residual Risk Evaluation

Under MDR Annex I, a device can only be placed on the market if its benefits outweigh its risks. Manufacturers must provide:

- Justification for why the device’s benefits outweigh risks.
- Assessment of clinical performance and risk data.
- Evidence that all reasonable risk reduction measures have been implemented.

### Residual Risk Evaluation
- After implementing risk control measures, any remaining risks must be clearly documented and justified.
- Residual risks must be communicated to users via IFU, warnings, or training.

## Post-Market Risk Management

Risk management does not end after market approval. Under MDR Article 83, risk-related data must be continuously collected, reviewed, and updated.

Key post-market risk management requirements:
- **Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) System**  
  - Ongoing collection of real-world data on device safety and performance.
- **Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF)**  
  - Required for Class III and implantable devices to assess long-term safety.
- **Corrective & Preventive Actions (CAPA)**  
  - Updates to design, IFU, or labeling in response to new risk data.

## Common Challenges & Best Practices

### Common Risk Management Issues
- Poor risk documentation → Notified bodies expect clear risk traceability.
- Weak risk-benefit justifications → Can lead to non-compliance.
- Failure to link RMS with PMS → Real-world data must feed back into risk management.

### Best Practices for Compliance
- Integrate risk management into the QMS (ISO 13485 compliance).
- Use structured risk evaluation methods (e.g., FMEA, FTA).
- Regularly update risk documentation based on post-market data.
- Ensure clear traceability between risks, design, and safety measures.
