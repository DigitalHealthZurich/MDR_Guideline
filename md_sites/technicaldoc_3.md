# Technical Documentation - Design and Manufacturing Information (Annex II, Section 3)

The design and manufacturing information forms a key component of the technical documentation required under MDR 2017/745. It provides regulatory authorities and notified bodies with a comprehensive understanding of the design and manufacturing processes, ensuring that all aspects relevant to safety and performance have been adequately addressed and documented.

This section outlines the required content for Design and Manufacturing Information, as mandated under Annex II, Section 3 of MDR 2017/745, and provides additional guidance to support manufacturers in compiling thorough and compliant documentation.

## Design Information

The documentation must include a complete description of the design processes applied to the device. The following elements are expected:

- A detailed outline of the design stages, from initial concept to the final design freeze.
- Justification for design choices, including how they align with the device's intended purpose and the identified risks.
- Comprehensive design specifications, covering:
    - Materials and components.
    - Functional and performance characteristics.
    - Software elements, where applicable, including architecture, versioning, and intended interactions with hardware components.
    - Physical, mechanical, and chemical properties.
- Design drawings, diagrams, and schematics necessary to fully understand the device's structure and operation.
- Clear identification of design inputs and outputs, including linkage to risk management processes.
- Records of all design changes, including the rationale for changes and the assessment of their potential impact on safety and performance.

Maintaining a traceable link between design inputs, risk controls, verification activities, and final design outputs is essential to demonstrate the application of a structured design process in line with regulatory expectations.

## Manufacturing Information

Manufacturers must provide comprehensive documentation of the manufacturing processes applied to the device. This includes:

- A description of all manufacturing processes, including the identification of critical process steps that directly impact device safety, performance, or compliance.
- Identification of key suppliers, subcontractors, and external partners performing significant stages of the manufacturing process.
- Specifications for raw materials, intermediate products, and final devices, with a clear definition of acceptance criteria at each stage.
- Environmental and process controls implemented to ensure product consistency, particularly where contamination risks, sterility, or specific environmental conditions influence product safety.
- Quality control and in-process testing performed at relevant stages of production, with defined acceptance criteria and records demonstrating conformity.
- Procedures for managing non-conforming products, including documented processes for product holds, rework, and product disposition decisions.

It is essential that the manufacturing processes documented in the technical documentation align with the actual processes employed at the production site, ensuring consistency between planned and actual processes.

## Common Challenges and Considerations

- **Traceability across design and manufacturing documentation**: Design requirements, risk controls, and verification outputs must be clearly and consistently linked to manufacturing processes, ensuring that risk mitigation measures are maintained throughout production.

- **Managing outsourced processes**: Where critical design or manufacturing activities are outsourced, manufacturers remain fully responsible for ensuring that all applicable MDR requirements are met. This requires documented supplier controls, agreements, and periodic audits to ensure continued compliance.

- **Change management and version control**: Design and manufacturing processes evolve over time. It is critical to establish robust version control and change management procedures to ensure that technical documentation accurately reflects the current state of design and production.

- **Software development and lifecycle documentation**: For devices incorporating software, the software development lifecycle, including all updates, patches, and risk assessments, must be fully documented and integrated into the overall design and manufacturing documentation.

- **Transparency and audit readiness**: During audits and conformity assessments, notified bodies expect full traceability from design requirements through to final product release. Maintaining clear, structured documentation that demonstrates design control, risk management, and manufacturing process validation is essential.
