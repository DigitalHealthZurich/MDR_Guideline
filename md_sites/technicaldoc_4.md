# Technical Documentation - General Safety and Performance Requirements (Annex II, Section 4)

The General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR) are the foundation for demonstrating compliance under MDR 2017/745. They outline the essential criteria that all medical devices must meet to ensure safety, performance, and conformity with regulatory expectations.

This section outlines the required content for addressing GSPR, as mandated under Annex II, Section 4 of MDR 2017/745, and provides additional practical guidance to support manufacturers in establishing a clear and auditable link between their device’s design, risk management, and performance evidence.

## Overview of GSPR Requirements

The GSPR list is found in **Annex I of MDR 2017/745** and serves as the primary benchmark for safety, performance, and risk management. Manufacturers must systematically assess how their device meets each applicable requirement and document the evidence supporting compliance.

The GSPR cover three main areas:
- **General requirements** – Overall device safety, performance, and benefit-risk balance.
- **Design and manufacturing requirements** – Specific requirements for design and production to minimize risks related to chemical, physical, and biological properties, infection, and environmental factors.
- **Information and labeling requirements** – Ensuring users and patients receive clear, accurate, and necessary information for safe use.

Each requirement applies to varying degrees based on device type, intended purpose, and risk class.

## Documenting Conformity

Manufacturers must create a comprehensive **GSPR Checklist** (sometimes called a GSPR Matrix), which serves as the structured evidence map between:

- Each individual requirement in Annex I.
- The specific design features, manufacturing controls, risk controls, and performance data that demonstrate conformity.
- References to specific sections in the technical documentation where evidence can be found.

The checklist should cover:
- The specific GSPR clause (including any sub-points).
- Whether the requirement applies (justification if not applicable).
- Summary of how conformity is achieved (design features, risk controls, testing, etc.).
- Reference to supporting evidence (design documents, risk management file, test reports, clinical evaluation, IFU, etc.).

This document is not static — it must be updated if design changes, intended purpose modifications, or regulatory changes affect any of the documented compliance strategies.

## Common Challenges and Considerations

- **Inconsistent linkage across documents**: One of the most common pitfalls is a lack of traceability between the GSPR checklist, risk management file, design documentation, and test reports. Consistency and clear cross-referencing are essential.

- **Determining applicability**: For some devices, certain GSPR clauses may not apply. It is critical to provide clear, well-justified explanations for any exclusions to avoid challenges during notified body reviews.

- **Over-reliance on standards**: While harmonized standards (e.g., ISO 10993 for biocompatibility) help demonstrate conformity, manufacturers must explicitly link those standards to specific GSPR clauses and document how the standard was applied to the device.

- **Managing updates**: As devices evolve, the GSPR checklist must be actively maintained to reflect design changes, new risk controls, or updated testing. Outdated GSPR checklists are a common finding in audits.

- **Software-specific challenges**: For devices containing software, special attention is needed for cybersecurity, software validation, and usability under the GSPR. Ensure that software lifecycle documentation (aligned with IEC 62304) maps directly to the applicable safety and performance requirements.
