# Technical Documentation - General Safety and Performance Requirements (Annex II, Section 4)

The General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR) are the foundation for demonstrating compliance under MDR 2017/745. They outline the essential criteria that all medical devices must meet to ensure safety, performance, and conformity with regulatory expectations.

This section outlines the required content for addressing GSPR, as mandated under Annex II, Section 4 of MDR 2017/745, and provides additional practical guidance to support manufacturers in establishing a clear and auditable link between their device’s design, risk management, and performance evidence.

## Overview of GSPR Requirements

The GSPR list is found in **Annex I of MDR 2017/745** and serves as the primary benchmark for safety, performance, and risk management. Manufacturers must systematically assess how their device meets each applicable requirement and document the evidence supporting compliance.

The GSPR cover three main areas:
- General requirements – Overall device safety, performance, and benefit-risk balance.
- Design and manufacturing requirements – Specific requirements for design and production to minimize risks related to chemical, physical, and biological properties, infection, and environmental factors.
- Information and labeling requirements – Ensuring users and patients receive clear, accurate, and necessary information for safe use.

Each requirement applies to varying degrees based on device type, intended purpose, and risk class.

## Documenting Conformity

Manufacturers must create a comprehensive **GSPR Checklist**, which serves as the structured evidence map between:

- Each individual requirement in Annex I.
- The specific design features, manufacturing controls, risk controls, and performance data that demonstrate conformity.
- References to specific sections in the technical documentation where evidence can be found.

The checklist should cover:
- The specific GSPR clause (including any sub-points).
- Whether the requirement applies (justification if not applicable).
- Summary of how conformity is achieved (design features, risk controls, testing, etc.).
- Reference to supporting evidence (design documents, risk management file, test reports, clinical evaluation, IFU, etc.).

This document must remain aligned with all changes to the device, and it requires updates if design modifications, regulatory changes, or new risk assessments affect previously documented compliance.

## Common Challenges and Considerations

- **Maintaining consistency across documentation**: One frequent issue is a lack of clear alignment between the GSPR checklist, risk management file, design documentation, and clinical evaluation. Consistency across these files is essential for demonstrating a coherent and complete compliance strategy.

- **Defining applicability correctly**: Not every GSPR requirement applies to every device. Manufacturers must clearly document when a requirement does not apply and provide a technical and regulatory justification. Vague or unsubstantiated exclusions are often questioned during notified body reviews.

- **Linking to harmonized standards**: While the use of harmonized standards can simplify the demonstration of conformity, manufacturers should explicitly show how these standards map to specific GSPR clauses. A reference to a standard alone is insufficient; clear explanations and evidence showing how the standard addresses specific safety and performance requirements are needed.

- **Cybersecurity and software-specific considerations**: For software devices, including software as a medical device (SaMD) or software embedded within a device, cybersecurity measures and software lifecycle documentation must align with applicable GSPR clauses. This includes ensuring the software meets state-of-the-art development practices, is validated appropriately, and is protected against unauthorized access and data breaches.

- **Comprehensive clinical evaluation alignment**: The GSPR checklist must align with conclusions drawn in the clinical evaluation report (CER). Any safety and performance claims made in the checklist must have supporting evidence in the CER and clinical data sources.

- **Post-market alignment and updates**: The GSPR checklist is not static and must be updated when new post-market surveillance data identifies new risks, performance limitations, or product enhancements that affect compliance with one or more GSPR requirements.

- **Technical documentation readiness**: Clearly organized and cross-referenced technical documentation simplifies notified body reviews. The GSPR checklist should act as a navigational tool pointing reviewers to exact sections in the design file, risk management file, clinical evaluation, and other supporting evidence.
