# **CE Product Categories – A Comprehensive Overview**
The **CE marking** is a certification that a product complies with the European Union’s safety, health, and environmental protection requirements. It is required for a wide range of products before they can be sold in the EU. Depending on the nature of a product, it may fall under one or several of the following CE product categories, each governed by specific EU directives or regulations.

## Scope of MDR and Related Directives
When determining whether a product is classified as a medical device under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR), it's important to consider the broader regulatory framework. While MDR is the primary regulation governing medical devices in the EU, certain products may still be subject to additional directives or regulations. This is because MDR focuses on aspects directly related to the safety and performance of medical devices, but other characteristics of a product—such as electrical safety, electromagnetic compatibility, or environmental impact—may require compliance with other EU directives.

For some products, multiple directives may apply. For example, an **electronic medical device** could fall under the **MDR**, the **RoHS Directive**, and the **EMC Directive** simultaneously.

The key criteria for determining which directives apply to a product include:
1. **Product Function**: What is the product designed to do?
2. **Components**: Does the product include electrical or electronic parts? 
3. **Operating Environment**: Does the product operate under high pressure or use radio frequencies? These factors would trigger the PED or RED, respectively.


## Key CE Product Categories and Applicable Directives

### Medical Device Regulation (MDR)
The MDR governs the safety and performance of medical devices, including both physical devices and software intended for medical purposes. It ensures high standards for devices used in patient care.
- **Regulation**: [2017/745](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745){:target="_blank"}


### Low Voltage Directive (LVD)
This directive applies to electrical equipment with a voltage range between **50 and 1000 volts AC** or **75 and 1500 volts DC**. It ensures that such products meet safety requirements to protect users from hazards such as electrical shock or fire.
- **Directive**: [2014/35/EU](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/electrical-and-electronic-engineering-industries-eei/low-voltage-directive-lvd_en){:target="_blank"}



### Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive (EMC)
The EMC Directive ensures that electronic devices do not emit electromagnetic disturbances that could affect other devices, and they are not susceptible to interference themselves. It applies to most electronic and electrical products.
- **Directive**: [2014/30/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/de/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0030){:target="_blank"}


### Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS)
This directive restricts the use of certain hazardous substances, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and others, in electrical and electronic equipment. Its goal is to reduce environmental and health risks.
- **Directive**: [2011/65/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011L0065){:target="_blank"}

### Machinery Directive
The Machinery Directive applies to machinery, including assemblies of parts or components that function together. It sets out essential health and safety requirements for machinery placed on the market.
- **Directive**: [2006/42/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/de/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32006L0042){:target="_blank"}


### Radio Equipment Directive (RED)
The RED covers all products that use the radio frequency spectrum to transmit and receive information. It ensures the safe use of the radio spectrum while avoiding interference with other equipment.
- **Directive**: [2014/53/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0053){:target="_blank"}


### Personal Protective Equipment Regulation (PPE)
This regulation applies to any equipment designed to be worn or held to protect against health and safety hazards. It sets stringent safety requirements for various types of protective gear.
- **Regulation**: [2016/425](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0425){:target="_blank"}


### Pressure Equipment Directive (PED)
The PED regulates the design, manufacture, and conformity assessment of pressure equipment and assemblies subjected to a pressure higher than 0.5 bar.
- **Directive**: [2014/68/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0068){:target="_blank"}


<!--### 8. Toys Safety Directive
- **Directive**: [2009/48/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32009L0048)
<!---- This directive sets specific safety requirements for toys to ensure they pose no harm to children’s health or safety. It covers physical, mechanical, chemical, and electrical safety aspects.-->


### General Product Safety Directive (GPSD)
This directive applies to any product placed on the market that is not covered by a specific directive. It requires that all consumer products are safe under normal and foreseeable conditions of use.
- **Directive**: [2001/95/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32001L0095){:target="_blank"}
