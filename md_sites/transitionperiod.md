# Transition Periods and Regulatory Pathway Selection
The transitional periods defined by the MDR govern the placement, availability, and use of medical devices already on the market before the MDR's full implementation. These periods depend on the device class, certificates' validity, and specific regulatory requirements.

# Scope

## New Products

Direct compliance with MDR is required without transitional periods.

## Legacy Devices (devices already on the market under MDD/AIMDD)

Transitional rules apply if the device holds a valid certificate issued before **May 26, 2021**. These provisions allow continued market placement while manufacturers transition to MDR. Compliance with these rules is essential to maintain regulatory approval and continued market placement. The following sections outline the specific conditions, timelines, and obligations during the transitional period.

# Key Conditions and Timelines

## Placement on the Market

Legacy devices can remain on the market if:

- The certificate was **valid as of May 26, 2021**, and has not expired.
- **No significant changes** in design or intended purpose have occurred.
- A **conformity assessment application under MDR** is submitted by **May 26, 2024**.

### Specific Timelines:

- **Class III and implantable Class IIb:** Placement allowed until **December 31, 2027**.
- **Other Class IIb, Class IIa, and Is/Im:** Placement allowed until **December 31, 2028**

## Availability and Use

- **As of February 2023**, there are no restrictions on the **continued availability** or **use of products** already on the market.

# Key Requirements During the Transitional Period

## Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) and Vigilance
- **Full compliance with MDR** is required from **May 26, 2021**, onward, even for legacy devices.

## Quality Management System (QMS)
- **MDR-compliant QMS** must be in place by **May 26, 2024** (**Article 10(9)**).

## Unique Device Identification (UDI)
- **Class III:** Required from **May 26, 2021**.
- **Class IIa/IIb:** Required from **May 26, 2023**.
- **Class I:** Required from **May 26, 2025**.

# Special Cases

## Well-Established Technologies
- Certain products *(e.g., sutures, staples)* have specific exemptions and may benefit from extended timelines.

### Definition of Well-Established Technologies

The MDR does not explicitly define well-established technologies (WET), but guidance documents provide criteria. According to the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG), WET are devices with:

- Long-term use (typically more than 10 years).
- Well-known safety and performance characteristics.
- Established technologies with little change over time.
- Low risk and well-established clinical use.

**[Refer to MDCG 2020-6](https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2020-09/md_mdcg_2020_6_guidance_sufficient_clinical_evidence_en_0.pdf){:target:"_blank"}**

### Exemptions for WET

Under **Article 61(4) of the MDR**, implantable and Class III devices generally require clinical investigations. However, exemptions exist if:

- The device has been demonstrated to be equivalent to an existing device.
- Sufficient clinical data is available.
- The device is based on a well-established technology.

**[Refer to MDCG 2023-7](https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-12/mdcg_2023-7_en.pdf){:target:"_blank"}**

### Examples of Well-Established Technologies

The MDR provides examples of WET, which include:

- Sutures
- Staples
- Dental fillings
- Dental braces
- Tooth crowns
- Screws
- Wedges
- Plates
- Wires
- Pins
- Clips
- Connectors

**[Refer to MDR Article 52(4)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R0745){:target:"_blank"}**

### Recommendation

Manufacturers should consult the MDR and relevant MDCG guidance documents to determine if their devices qualify as WET and to understand applicable exemptions. It is essential to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements and to consult with regulatory authorities or notified bodies when necessary.

## Custom-Made Class III Implantable Devices
- Eligible for placement without an MDR QMS certificate until **May 26, 2026**, provided certain conditions are met.
