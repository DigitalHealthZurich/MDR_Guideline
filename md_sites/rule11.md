# Rule 11 - Classification of Software as a Medical Device

After confirming that the software is standalone, **MDR Annex VIII, Chapter III, Rule 11** applies, which classifies software based on the potential impact of its use on patient health.

## Classification Criteria

- **Class III**  
  Software that provides information used to make decisions with potential to cause death or irreversible deterioration of health.

- **Class IIb**  
  Software providing information for decisions that could lead to serious health deterioration or surgical intervention.

- **Class IIa**  
  Software offering information for decisions with a lower impact on health.

- **Class I**  
  Software not intended for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.

## Practical Implications

Most standalone software fall not into Class I, leading to increased regulatory requirements:

- **Involvement of Notified Bodies**  
  Higher-classified software requires assessment by notified bodies, increasing compliance efforts.

- **Quality Management Systems (QMS)**  
  Manufacturers must implement and maintain a QMS, adhering to standards like ISO 13485.

These requirements can significantly impact smaller developers, such as startups and university spin-offs, due to the resources needed for compliance.

## Considerations for Manufacturers

- **Risk Assessment**  
  Evaluate the potential impact of software decisions on patient health to determine the appropriate classification.

- **Regulatory Planning**  
  Prepare for the necessary conformity assessment procedures based on the software's classification.

- **Resource Allocation**  
  Anticipate the need for additional resources to meet regulatory obligations, especially for higher-risk classifications.
