# Is the Software Standalone Software under MDR 2017/745?

This section determines whether the software qualifies as a standalone software while qualifying as a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD).

---

## Decision Criteria
To determine if software is a **standalone software** under MDR:

- It functions independently of a specific hardware medical device (i.e., it is not embedded in or dependent on a medical device for its function).
- It performs a medical function on its own, such as:
   - Diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment, or alleviation of disease.
   - Providing diagnostic or therapeutic decision support.
   - Analyzing patient data for clinical purposes.
<br><br>
- If **yes** → The device follows classification under **MDR Annex VIII, Chapter III, Rule 11**.

    - [Read Annex VIII, Rule 11 of MDR 2017/745](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745#anx_VIII)

    - [Refer to MDCG 2019-11 for Software Qualification and Classification](https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2020-09/md_mdcg_2019_11_guidance_qualification_classification_software_en_0.pdf)


- If **no** → The software is not considered standalone software** and may be classified based on Intended Purpose and integration within a medical device system.
