# Provide Non-Clinical Evaluation under MDR Annex XIV

Non-clinical evaluation is a critical part of the clinical evaluation process under MDR 2017/745. It involves assessing preclinical data to demonstrate that a medical device meets the General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR) of Annex I* before clinical data is considered.

This section outlines how manufacturers can use non-clinical evidence to support the clinical evaluation, ensuring compliance with MDR Annex XIV.

## Regulatory Basis for Non-Clinical Evaluation

According to MDR Annex XIV, Part A, Section 1, manufacturers must consider all relevant preclinical and clinical data in their clinical evaluation. Non-clinical data plays a crucial role in supporting safety and performance claims, particularly when:

- The device is based on **well-established technologies** with existing preclinical evidence.
- Clinical data is **limited or unavailable**, requiring robust preclinical justification.
- The device undergoes **modifications or improvements** that necessitate additional non-clinical verification.

Non-clinical evaluation is especially important for devices classified as low-risk (Class I or IIa) or where clinical investigations are not required under Article 61(10).

## Types of Non-Clinical Data

Non-clinical evaluation includes several categories of data sources that help demonstrate a device’s safety, functionality, and intended purpose:

### **1. Preclinical Testing and Bench Studies**
- **Biocompatibility testing** (ISO 10993 series) to evaluate material safety.
- **Electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility** (IEC 60601 series for active devices).
- **Mechanical testing** (e.g., fatigue, stress, durability for implants and structural components).
- **Software verification and validation** (IEC 62304 for software as a medical device).

### **2. Literature Review and Existing Scientific Data**
- Published studies and technical reports that validate similar technologies.
- Use of **scientific models and simulations** for device performance evaluation.
- Historical data on equivalent or predicate devices where applicable.

### **3. In-Vitro Testing**
- Functional testing under **controlled laboratory conditions** to verify device performance.
- **Material characterization** and chemical analysis to ensure biocompatibility.
- **Sterilization validation** and packaging integrity assessments.

### **4. Computational Modeling and Simulations**
- Use of **finite element analysis (FEA)** and **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** to predict device behavior.
- **Digital twin models** for performance validation in various conditions.

## Criteria for Assessing Non-Clinical Data

Non-clinical data must be evaluated based on its **relevance, reliability, and applicability** to the device under assessment. Key factors include:

- **Scientific Validity**: The data must be generated using standardized, repeatable methods.
- **Reproducibility**: Testing should be performed under controlled conditions, following recognized standards.
- **Device-Specific Relevance**: The data must directly apply to the specific device, materials, and intended use.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Testing protocols should align with MDR-recognized standards such as **ISO 10993, IEC 60601, ISO 62304, and ISO 14971**.

If manufacturers rely on *existing literature or equivalent device data, they must provide a justification for its relevance and applicability under MDR’s equivalence criteria.

## Integration with the Clinical Evaluation Report

Non-clinical data serves as the foundation for the Clinical Evaluation Report and must be clearly documented. The Clinical Evaluation Report should:

- Include a summary of **all relevant non-clinical data** that supports safety and performance claims.
- Justify why non-clinical data is **sufficient for demonstrating compliance** with GSPR.
- Clearly define any **limitations of preclinical evidence** and justify if additional clinical data is required.
- Align with the **risk management file** to ensure all identified risks are supported by appropriate testing and validation.

For devices where clinical data is limited, manufacturers must demonstrate that non-clinical evidence is robust enough to ensure regulatory compliance and patient safety.
