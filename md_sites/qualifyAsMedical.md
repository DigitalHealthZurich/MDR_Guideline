# Determining Whether a Device Qualifies as a Medical Device
This section provides a structured approach to determining whether a device qualifies as a medical device under Article 2 of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745.

## Step 1: Review the MDR Definition
The first step is to examine the **MDR definition of a medical device** as stated in **Article 2(1)**:

> "A medical device is any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant, reagent, material, or other article intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human beings for specific medical purposes, such as diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment, or alleviation of disease."

## Step 2: Assess the Intended Purpose
Manufacturers must define the **Intended Purpose** of their product, as described in **labeling, instructions for use, and promotional materials**. The intended purpose must align with the medical uses outlined in the MDR.

Key considerations:
- Does the product diagnose, prevent, monitor, treat, or alleviate a disease or injury?
- Is it used for investigation, replacement, or modification of anatomy or physiological processes?
- Is it intended to provide information by in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body?

## Step 3: Evaluate the Principal Mode of Action
A product qualifies as a **medical device** only if it achieves its principal intended action **by non-pharmacological, non-immunological, or non-metabolic means**.

To assess this:
- Does the product act mechanically or physically on the body?
- Does it provide therapeutic or diagnostic functions without chemical or metabolic interactions?
- If the product has a combination of actions, what is its primary mode?
- For combination products, does the medical device component play a primary role?

## Step 4: Consider Inclusions and Exclusions
Certain products may be explicitly **included** or **excluded** under MDR. Review additional guidance to confirm classification.

- **Included:** Standalone software performing medical functions (e.g., diagnostic decision support), aesthetic products with similar risks to medical devices.
- **Excluded:** Products achieving primary action through pharmacological, immunological, or metabolic means (regulated under medicinal product laws).
- **Combination Products:** Devices combined with medicinal substances may fall under MDR or medicinal product regulations (see Article 117 for drug-device combinations).

## Step 5: Address Borderline Cases
Some products may not clearly fit into the definition of a medical device. The **European Commissionâ€™s Guidance on Borderline and Classification Issues** provides clarification for such cases.

- **Examples of borderline cases:**
  - Health and wellness applications vs. medical software.
  - Cosmetic devices vs. aesthetic medical devices (Annex XVI products).
  - Drug-device combination products where classification depends on primary action.
