# Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) & Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF)

Under **MDR 2017/745 Annex III**, manufacturers are required to establish and maintain a **Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) system** for all medical devices. This system must be proactive, structured, and documented, ensuring that safety and performance data is continuously collected, analyzed, and acted upon.  

For higher-risk devices, **Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF)** is required to gather additional clinical data and validate ongoing safety and effectiveness.  

This section outlines PMS and PMCF obligations, key implementation steps, and regulatory expectations.

## Regulatory Basis for PMS

### **MDR Annex III - PMS Requirements**
MDR Annex III mandates that all manufacturers implement a PMS system** to:  
- **Continuously monitor** device performance in real-world use.  
- **Detect and prevent** risks that may emerge post-market.  
- **Ensure compliance** with safety and performance requirements (Annex I - GSPR).  
- **Feed PMS data** into the risk management, clinical evaluation, and QMS processes.  

For higher-risk devices, PMS must also integrate **PMCF**, ensuring continuous clinical validation.

## Key Elements of a PMS System

A complian PMS system must include:

1. **PMS Plan**  
   - Outlines the manufacturer’s approach to collecting and analyzing post-market data.
   - Defines responsibilities, methods, and reporting requirements.  

2. **Data Collection & Analysis**  
   - Sources include complaints, adverse events, registries, published literature, and user feedback.  
   - Data is analyzed to identify trends, risks, and necessary corrective actions.  

3. **Periodic Reports & Regulatory Submissions**  
   - **Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSUR)** (for Class IIa, IIb, III devices).  
   - **Summary of Safety & Clinical Performance (SSCP)** (for Class III & implantables).  
   - **Vigilance Reporting** (adverse event reporting).  

4. **Integration with Risk Management & QMS**  
   - PMS findings must update **risk assessments, design, and manufacturing processes**.  
   - Linked with **ISO 14971 risk management requirements**.  

5. **Corrective & Preventive Actions**  
   - PMS system must trigger corrective and preventive actions to address safety concerns.

## Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF)

PMCF is a **specific PMS activity** required for:  
✅ **Class III and implantable devices** (mandatory).  
✅ Devices where **long-term safety, performance, or rare complications** require further data.  

### **PMCF Objectives**
- Confirm ongoing safety and performance.
- Detect rare or delayed adverse events.
- Address gaps in clinical data from pre-market evaluation.
- Verify long-term device effectiveness.

### **PMCF Plan Requirements**
- Description of methods for clinical data collection.
- Justification of why PMCF is (or isn’t) necessary.
- Integration with the **clinical evaluation report (CER)**.

## Implementing a PMS Plan (ISO 20416)

ISO **20416:2020** provides guidance for structuring a PMS Plan.  
A **PMS Plan** should define:

1. **Objectives** → What data must be collected?  
2. **Data Sources** → Complaints, literature, clinical data, registries, etc.  
3. **Methodology** → How will data be collected, analyzed, and reported?  
4. **Responsibilities** → Who is responsible for PMS activities?  
5. **Risk-based approach** → PMS strategy should be proportional to device risks.

## Common Challenges & Best Practices

**Common PMS Issues**  
- **Failure to act on PMS data** → Notified bodies expect clear follow-ups.  
- **Insufficient clinical data for PMCF** → Can lead to non-compliance.  
- **Weak integration with QMS** → PMS must feed into Corrective & Preventive Actions, risk management.  
- **Lack of periodic reporting** → PSUR & vigilance reporting are strictly enforced.

**Best Practices for Compliance**  
- **Use automated PMS tracking systems** to centralize post-market data.  
- **Regularly review and update risk assessments** based on PMS findings.  
- **Conduct proactive data collection** (not just rely on complaints & incidents).  
- **Prepare for audits by maintaining complete PMS documentation**.
