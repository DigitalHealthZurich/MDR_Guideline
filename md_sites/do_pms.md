# Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) in Action under MDR

Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) is a continuous proces that ensures medical devices remain safe and effective throughout their lifecycle. Under MDR 2017/745, manufacturers must proactively collect, analyze, and act on post-market data to identify risks, performance issues, and areas for improvement.

Unlike the PMS planning phase, which focuses on defining strategies, this page explains how PMS is implemented in practice — how manufacturers monitor, evaluate, and respond to real-world device performance.

## Regulatory Basis for PMS

**MDR Article 83** requires manufacturers to establish and maintain a PMS that:
- Collects and evaluates post-market data to ensure continued safety and performance.
- Detects new risks or changes in the benefit-risk profile.
- Supports regulatory compliance, including updates to technical documentation and risk management.

Manufacturers must document PMS activities in:
- **Post-Market Surveillance Plan (PMS Plan)** – Defines monitoring strategies (MDR Annex III).
- **Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) / Post-Market Surveillance Report (PMSR)** – Summarizes findings based on device risk class (MDR Article 86/85).

## Sources of Post-Market Data

Post-market data comes from *various real-world sources, including:

### **1. Customer and User Feedback**
- Complaints, reports from healthcare professionals, and patient feedback.
- Surveys and structured post-market questionnaires.

### **2. Vigilance Reporting and Incident Data**
- Reports of serious incidents submitted to competent authorities.
- Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCA) and recall data.

### **3. Literature and Market Surveillance**
- Scientific publications, registry studies, and competitor device comparisons.
- Reports from market surveillance authorities.

### **4. Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF) Studies**
- Clinical investigations and registries tracking real-world performance.
- Long-term safety and effectiveness evaluations.

## Data Analysis and Trend Reporting

Manufacturers must analyze collected data to identify patterns that could indicate safety or performance issues. Key activities include:

- **Trend Analysis** – Detecting early signs of risk before incidents occur.
- **Signal Detection** – Identifying unexpected events that may require regulatory action.
- **Comparative Assessment** – Benchmarking against similar devices or industry standards.
- **Evaluation of Risk-Benefit Ratio** – Ensuring risks remain justified based on real-world data.

Findings from PMS data analysis must be reflected in:
- The **Risk Management File (ISO 14971)**.
- The **Clinical Evaluation Report (CER)** if safety/performance updates are needed.

## Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)

If PMS data reveals emerging risks or performance issues, manufacturers must take action through Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA):

- **Corrective Actions**: Address existing problems (e.g., recalls, design modifications, labeling changes).
- **Preventive Actions**: Reduce the likelihood of future issues (e.g., process improvements, updated training, enhanced monitoring).
- **Regulatory Reporting**: If required, manufacturers must notify authorities of corrective actions taken (e.g., FSCA reports).

## Link to Risk Management and Clinical Evaluation

PMS findings must be continuously integrated into:
- **Risk Management (ISO 14971)** – Update risk assessments when new hazards emerge.
- **Clinical Evaluation** – Incorporate PMS insights into ongoing clinical evaluation cycles.
- **Regulatory Submissions** – If major safety issues are identified, manufacturers may need to notify authorities and update technical documentation.
