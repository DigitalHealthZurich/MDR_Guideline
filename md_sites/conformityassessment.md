## Conformity Assessment Based on Type Examination

EU Type-Examination is a conformity assessment procedure under **MDR Annex X**, where a notified body evaluates a medical device and its technical documentation to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. This process involves reviewing design, clinical evidence, and manufacturing processes, along with conducting tests to verify conformity with **General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR)**. If the device meets the necessary standards, an EU Type-Examination Certificate is issued.

Manufacturers must submit an application that includes technical documentation and a representative sample of the device. Any significant changes to the approved device, such as modifications in intended purpose or design, must be reported to the notified body for additional review and approval.

Manufacturers are required to maintain documentation for at least 10 years (or 15 years for implantable devices), ensuring traceability and compliance over the deviceâ€™s lifecycle.

For full details, refer to the official **[MDR Annex X](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745#anx_X)**.

## Procedure for Certain Class IIb and Class III Devices

Specific assessment procedures require the involvement of expert panels, particularly for Class IIb and Class III devices. These procedures ensure that high-risk medical devices undergo rigorous scrutiny before market approval. Notified bodies must consult expert panels in the context of clinical evaluation for certain devices as specified in **Article 54** and must notify competent authorities and the Commission through the electronic system outlined in Article 57. **Article 55** further establishes the scrutiny mechanism for conformity assessments, detailing cases where expert panel input is necessary. Additional procedural details are provided in Annex IX, Section 5.1, and Annex X, Section 6, outlining the requirements for type-examination and clinical evaluation consultation.  

For detailed requirements, refer to the relevant articles in **Chapter V: Classification and Conformity Assessment, Section 2** of the official **[MDR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745)**.

## Production Quality Assurance
Annex XI, Part A of the MDR outlines the conformity assessment procedure based on product quality assurance. This approach allows manufacturers to ensure and declare that their medical devices consistently meet the provisions of the MDR.

Key aspects include:

- **Quality Management System (QMS)**: Manufacturers must implement a QMS that covers all stages from design to final inspection. This system should ensure compliance with MDR requirements and be subject to periodic audits by a notified body.

- **Technical Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation demonstrating conformity with applicable regulations must be maintained and made available for review.

- **Surveillance**: Regular assessments and audits by the notified body ensure ongoing compliance and address any necessary corrective actions.


For detailed information, refer to the official **[MDR Annex XI](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745#anx_XI)**.

## Product Verification

Product verification (Annex XI, Part B) is a conformity assessment procedure ensuring that each manufactured device meets the type described in the **EU type-examination certificate** and complies with the applicable MDR requirements.

Manufacturers must implement measures to guarantee that their production process consistently produces compliant devices. Before manufacturing, documentation must be prepared, particularly regarding sterilization procedures where applicable. Additionally, a **post-market surveillance (PMS) plan** and vigilance procedures must be established and maintained.

Notified bodies conduct individual or batch-based examinations and testing to verify product conformity. For each approved device, they affix an identification number and issue an EU product verification certificate. Devices incorporating medicinal substances derived from human blood or plasma require additional batch verification procedures.

Manufacturers must retain documentation, including the EU declaration of conformity, for at least 10 years (or 15 years for implantable devices). Special provisions apply to **Class IIa devices**, where verification focuses on compliance with technical documentation rather than full individual testing.

For full details, refer to the [official MDR text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745).
