# Conformity Assessment Annex IX-XI Chapter V Classification and Conformity Assessment

The conformity assessment process is the formal procedure that medical device manufacturers must follow to demonstrate that their product complies with all applicable requirements under MDR 2017/745 before placing it on the market.

The exact steps depend heavily on device classification — the higher the risk, the more comprehensive the assessment. For lower-risk devices, manufacturers may self-certify, while for higher-risk devices, a Notified Body must be involved to independently assess documentation, quality management processes, and clinical evidence.

The conformity assessment isn’t just a one-time hurdle before placing a device on the market — it also links directly to the post-market surveillance system manufacturers must maintain, ensuring that safety and performance are continuously monitored and documented after the device is in use.

The goal of the process is to make sure that every medical device placed on the EU market is safe, performs as intended, and offers benefits that outweigh any risks.

The MDR offers several conformity assessment routes, described in Annex IX, X, and XI, each designed for different types and classes of devices. Choosing the right route depends on classification, intended purpose, and specific device characteristics, such as whether the device is sterile, measuring, implantable, or custom-made.

This page provides an overview of these different routes, their requirements, and how they fit into the larger framework of MDR compliance.

## Device Classification as the Starting Point

The conformity assessment process begins after determining the **device classification**. Devices are classified into Class I, IIa, IIb, or III according to the rules in **Annex VIII**. 

The classification determines the level of regulatory scrutiny and the required conformity assessment procedure.

## Mandatory Notified Body Involvement Based on Risk

**Article 52** defines which conformity assessment procedure applies depending on the class of the device.

- Class I devices (non-sterile, non-measuring) may follow self-certification procedures.
- Class IIa, IIb, and III devices require involvement of a **Notified Body**, with the level of scrutiny increasing for higher-risk devices.

## Devices Incorporating Medicinal Substances, Animal Tissues, or Human Tissues

Devices that incorporate medicinal substances, tissues of animal origin, or substances derived from human blood or plasma require additional consultation procedures with relevant competent authorities.

[→ Article 52(10-11)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745#d1e3572-88-1)

## Class III Implantable Devices - Expert Panel Consultation

Class III implantable devices are subject to additional consultation processes involving **expert panels** during the clinical evaluation process to ensure sufficient scrutiny before market approval.

[→ Article 54 - Clinical Evaluation Consultation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745#d1e3740-92-1)

---

## Post-Market Surveillance Integration

All conformity assessment procedures must include a **Post-Market Surveillance (PMS)** system to ensure continuous oversight and data collection on device safety and performance after market entry.

[→ Article 83 - Post-Market Surveillance System](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745#d1e5670-134-1)

## Technical Documentation and Quality Management System

The technical documentation required for conformity assessment must meet the requirements of **Annex II** and the PMS documentation must comply with **Annex III**. 

Additionally, the manufacturer’s **Quality Management System (QMS)** must meet the requirements laid out in **Annex IX**.

Refer to:
- [Annex II - Technical Documentation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745#anx_II)
- [Annex III - Technical Documentation on PMS](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745#anx_III)
- [Annex IX - Conformity Assessment Based on QMS and Technical Documentation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745#anx_IX)

## Special Provisions for Custom-Made Devices

Custom-made devices follow a simplified conformity assessment route, but **Class III implantable custom-made devices** require **Notified Body involvement**.
