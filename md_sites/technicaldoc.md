# Overview - Technical Documentation (Annex II)

This page provides a structured overview of the requirements for technical documentation under MDR 2017/745, as defined in Annex II. Technical documentation serves as the core evidence that a medical device meets applicable regulatory requirements for safety, performance, and conformity. It supports initial conformity assessment, ongoing regulatory compliance, and post-market surveillance activities, while forming the primary basis for regulatory inspections and audits.

Technical documentation must cover the entire lifecycle of the device, from design and development through manufacturing, clinical evaluation, and post-market activities. Its structure must ensure clear traceability across all elements, allowing notified bodies and regulatory authorities to understand how design decisions, risk management measures, and performance verification link together to ensure device safety and performance.

The technical documentation is divided into six main topics, each addressing specific regulatory expectations while collectively forming a coherent and traceable record of compliance.

## General Requirements and Structure

Annex II defines a structured format for technical documentation, applicable to all devices regardless of classification. Documentation must demonstrate:

- A clear definition of the device, its variants, accessories, and intended purpose.
- Comprehensive evidence of conformity with the General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR) from Annex I.
- Systematic identification, evaluation, and mitigation of risks across the entire lifecycle.
- Verification that the device meets intended performance under normal and foreseeable conditions.
- Effective post-market surveillance to continuously ensure safety and performance.

The documentation must remain aligned with the manufacturer’s quality management system (QMS), ensuring that design and manufacturing processes described in the technical documentation reflect the actual procedures used, as required by ISO 13485.

## Integrated Elements of Technical Documentation

The six main parts of the technical documentation are follwing:

- [**Device Description and Specification, Including Variants and Accessories**](https://digitalhealthzurich.github.io/MDR_Guideline/md_sites/technicaldoc_1.html) provides a complete overview of the device, including its identification (product or trade name, Basic UDI-DI, or other unique identifier), intended purpose, and any variants or configurations. It covers functional elements, components, software, and materials, and includes diagrams or illustrations where necessary. Technical specifications such as performance attributes and dimensions are also documented. This section further defines intended users, patient groups, medical conditions addressed, indications, contraindications, and warnings. Additionally, it outlines predecessor or comparable products and highlights any novel features, along with the regulatory basis for classifying the product as a medical device.

- [**Information to Be Supplied by the Manufacturer**](https://digitalhealthzurich.github.io/MDR_Guideline/md_sites/technicaldoc_2.html) covers all labeling, packaging, and instructions for use (IFU), ensuring that users and patients receive accurate and understandable information essential for safe use and performance monitoring. This includes specifying the languages used, the labeling requirements for different markets, and ensuring alignment with the device's intended purpose and risk management measures.

- [**Design and Manufacturing Information**](https://digitalhealthzurich.github.io/MDR_Guideline/md_sites/technicaldoc_3.html) documents the complete design and manufacturing process, covering all design phases, manufacturing steps, applied quality controls, and final inspections. It also includes the materials and auxiliary substances used, as well as information on involved suppliers and subcontractors. This ensures that the final product consistently conforms to the design intent, risk controls, and regulatory requirements..

- [**General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR)**](https://digitalhealthzurich.github.io/MDR_Guideline/md_sites/technicaldoc_4.html) systematically lists all applicable requirements from Annex I and documents how the device meets each one. This section specifies the methods and standards applied to demonstrate conformity, including testing, risk control measures, and clinical evidence. Each requirement is linked to supporting documents to ensure traceability across the technical documentation.

- [**Benefit-Risk Analysis and Risk Management**](https://digitalhealthzurich.github.io/MDR_Guideline/md_sites/technicaldoc_5.html) documents how risks are identified, assessed, and controlled across all stages of the device lifecycle, following the principles of ISO 14971. This section also provides a clear rationale demonstrating that the overall residual risks are acceptable in relation to the device's intended benefits, ensuring alignment with the intended purpose, clinical evaluation, and post-market surveillance data.

- [**Verification and Validation Information**](https://digitalhealthzurich.github.io/MDR_Guideline/md_sites/technicaldoc_6.html) consolidates all evidence demonstrating that the device meets its design specifications, intended purpose, and applicable safety and performance requirements under normal and foreseeable conditions of use. This includes pre-clinical testing (covering biocompatibility, electrical safety, electromagnetic compatibility, software verification and validation, and other relevant tests), stability and shelf-life testing, and clinical evaluation data. Test selection and acceptance criteria should be clearly justified based on the device’s intended purpose, risk profile, and applicable General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR). Verification and validation activities must cover all critical performance attributes, intended operating environments, and relevant interfaces, ensuring the device consistently achieves its claimed performance across the entire lifecycle.

## Practical Guidance and Best Practices

- **Maintain a living documentation system:** Technical documentation evolves throughout the product lifecycle. Design changes, updates to manufacturing processes, new risk information, and post-market data must all be reflected in real time.

- **Ensure full traceability:** All elements of technical documentation — from design inputs to risk controls to clinical claims — must be cross-referenced and traceable. This is key to demonstrating design control and risk management effectiveness.

- **Align with the Quality Management System:** The documentation should not exist in isolation. It must directly correspond to the processes defined in the QMS, especially those governing design and development, risk management, and post-market surveillance.

- **Audit readiness:** Well-structured, cross-referenced documentation facilitates faster, smoother notified body reviews. Ensure all key processes, decisions, and justifications can be easily followed by external auditors.

- **Modular documentation strategies:** For product families or complex portfolios, modular documentation (separating core information from device-specific content) improves manageability and makes updates more efficient.

- **Lifecycle consistency:** From initial design to post-market activities, technical documentation should remain consistent with actual product performance, risk data, and user feedback collected over time.
