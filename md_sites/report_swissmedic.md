# Report to Swissmedic & Define Necessary Changes

Under the Swiss Medical Devices Ordinance (MedDO; SR 812.213), manufacturers, authorized representatives, and importers must report certain incidents and safety-related corrective actions to Swissmedic, Switzerland’s competent authority for medical devices. This obligation ensures continuous post-market surveillance and patient safety.

This page outlines mandatory vigilance reporting requirements, timelines, and how manufacturers must implement necessary changes based on post-market data.

## Regulatory Basis for Reporting to Swissmedic

Swissmedic enforces vigilance reporting requirements in accordance with:

- Medical Devices Ordinance (MedDO; SR 812.213), Articles 66-69
- Therapeutic Products Act (TPA; SR 812.21)
- Alignment with EU MDR 2017/745 vigilance requirements

Swissmedic's vigilance reporting system covers:
- **Serious incidents** involving medical devices.
- **Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCAs)** such as recalls, software updates, labeling changes, or safety notices.

Swissmedic's Market Surveillance actively monitors compliance with these reporting requirements.

- **Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCAs)** to reduce device-related risks.

### **2. Who Must Report?**
- Manufacturers placing medical devices on the Swiss market.
- Authorized Representatives (CH-REP) for foreign manufacturers.
- Importers who become aware of reportable incidents.

### **3. Reporting Deadlines**
| Incident Type | Reporting Deadline |
|--------------|------------------|
| Serious incident leading to death or serious health deterioration | **2 days** |

## Implementing Necessary Changes

### **1. Evaluating the Need for Corrective Actions**
Manufacturers must analyze reported incidents to determine if:
- A device modification (e.g., software update, design change) is necessary.
- Additional risk mitigation measures should be implemented.
- Labeling, user instructions, or training require revision.

### **2. Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCA)**
If corrective actions are needed, manufacturers must:
- Issue a **Field Safety Notice (FSN)** to inform users of risks and corrective measures.
- Communicate with Swissmedic regarding actions taken.
- Implement updates in technical documentation, risk management files, and post-market surveillance (PMS) plans.

Swissmedic monitors compliance with FSCAs through market surveillance activities.
