# Intended Purpose

## General Intended Purpose
Before determining classification or regulatory requirements, manufacturers must establish the general intended purpose of their product. This high-level definition is the starting point for determining whether the product qualifies as a medical device under **MDR Article 2(1)**.

At this stage, the general intended purpose should:
- Describe the deviceâ€™s **primary function** (e.g., diagnosis, treatment, prevention, monitoring).
- Identify its **target users** (e.g., healthcare professionals, patients).
- Specify the **broad medical field** or condition it relates to (e.g., cardiology, dermatology).
- Indicate if it **interacts with the body** (e.g., invasive, non-invasive, active device).

If the product meets the definition of a medical device under **MDR Article 2(1)**, the next steps involve refining the **detailed intended purpose** (**MDR Article 2(12)**), determining classification (**Annex VIII**), and defining **conformity assessment** requirements.

## Detailed Intended Purpose
The **Intended Purpose** is a critical component of the **technical documentation** for a medical device.

A precisely defined Intended Purpose serves as the foundation for:
- **Classification** (*MDR Annex VIII*)
- **Regulatory approval** and conformity assessment
- **Risk management** (*ISO 14971 compliance*)
- **Unique Device Identification (UDI) definition**
- **Clinical evaluation** (*MDR Annex XIV*)
- **Usability testing and validation**

### Common Mistakes
- **Unclear, incomplete, or contradictory statements** may delay approval and trigger audit issues.
- **Writing a functional description** instead of a **purpose-oriented statement**.

### Consistency Across Documentation
To achieve regulatory approval **without delays**, the **Intended Purpose must be consistently reflected** across all relevant documentation. This includes:
- **Technical documentation**
- **Clinical evaluation reports**
- **Risk management files**
- **Marketing claims**
- **Instructions for use**

Any discrepancies can lead to **regulatory investigation, rejection, or extensive revisions**. A common issue arises when **marketing claims exaggerate or misrepresent** the device's function compared to its officially stated Intended Purpose. 

**Example:** If marketing materials claim that a device "detects skin cancer with AI," but the Intended Purpose states that it only "assists dermatologists in risk assessment," this inconsistency can lead to regulatory scrutiny.

Ensuring precise, legally compliant wording from the outset aligns with:
- **ISO 14971** (Risk Management)
- **ISO 13485** (Quality Management)
- **MDR Requirements**
- **IEC 62366-1 (Chapter 5.1)** (Use Specification)
- **IEC 60601-1** (Use Environment Requirements)

## Medical Purpose
Clearly state the **medical function** the device fulfills:

- **Diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment, or alleviation** of a disease, injury, or condition.
- **Prediction or assessment** of medical conditions.

**Example:** The device helps in diagnosing â€¦ by doing/providing â€¦

---

## Target Patient Population
Define the **patients** for whom the device is intended based on:

- **Medical condition or disease**
- **Demographics** (e.g., age, gender)
- **Comorbidities**
- **Anatomical application** (e.g., heart, skin, bones, etc.)

**Example:** For patient group â€¦ with the following condition â€¦

---

## Intended Users
Define **who will operate the device**:

- **Medical professionals** (e.g., doctors, nurses, radiologists)
- **Patients** (self-use devices like apps or glucose monitors)
- **Training requirements** (e.g., must be used by certified specialists)
- **Language, cognitive abilities, or physical restrictions** relevant to use

**Example:** Designed/Intended for use by â€¦ trained to/by â€¦

---

## Usage Context (Use Environment and Normal Use)
Describe **where and under what conditions** the device is used:

- **Clinical settings** (e.g., hospitals, emergency care, home healthcare)
- **Physical factors** (e.g., humidity, temperature, vibrations in transport)
- **Social factors** (e.g., stress, workload, distractions in operating rooms)
- **Other usage situations** (e.g., updates, configurations, cleaning, transport, storage)

**Example:** Designed for (home use, on-site hospital use, etc.) by â€¦, requiring â€¦

---

## Exclusions & Limitations
Explicitly state:

- **What the device is NOT intended for.**
- **What conditions or patient groups it should NOT be used on.**
- **Environmental conditions where it is unsafe.**

**Example:** Not for use on/in â€¦
