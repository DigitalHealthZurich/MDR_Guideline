# Classification Overview
The classification process is based on the **intended purpose** of the device and its inherent **risks**, as defined in **MDR Annex VIII**.

---

## Classification Levels
Devices are classified into four risk-based categories:
- **Class I**: Low risk (e.g., non-invasive devices such as bandages or stethoscopes).
- **Class IIa**: Medium risk (e.g., short-term invasive devices like catheters).
- **Class IIb**: Higher risk (e.g., long-term implantable devices such as pacemakers).
- **Class III**: Highest risk (e.g., devices in direct contact with the heart or central nervous system).

## Classifying a Medical Device
To classify a medical device, manufacturers must review the **22 classification rules** in **MDR Annex VIII**:

- **Non-invasive Devices (Rules 1-4)**: Consider duration of use and anatomical location.
- **Invasive Devices (Rules 5-8)**: Focus on invasiveness and duration.
- **Active Devices (Rules 9-13)**: Address devices with electrical or other energy sources.
- **Special Rules (Rules 14-22)**: Cover specific cases like contraceptive devices or those incorporating medicinal substances.

Manufacturers must apply the **appropriate classification rules** based on the device's **characteristics and intended purpose**. Proper documentation of the classification process, including the **rationale for the chosen class**, is a critical part of the **device's technical documentation**.

## Classification Rules

### Non-invasive Devices (Rules 1-4)
- These rules cover devices that **do not penetrate the body**.
- Key factors include **duration of use** and **contact location**.

### Invasive Devices (Rules 5-8)
- These rules apply to **devices introduced into the body**.
- Classification depends on the **route of introduction** and **length of use**.

### Active Devices (Rules 9-13)
- These rules cover devices that **rely on an energy source**.
- Includes **diagnostic and therapeutic electrical devices**.

### Special Rules (Rules 14-22)
- These rules address **specific device types**, including:
  - **Contraceptive devices**
  - **Devices incorporating medicinal substances**
  - **Substances used for organ preservation**
  - **Devices utilizing nanomaterials**
