# Technical Documentation - Information to Be Supplied by the Manufacturer (Annex II, Section 2)

The manufacturer must provide all information necessary for the safe use of the device, including clear, accurate, and comprehensive instructions and labeling. This information must align with the device’s intended purpose, risk profile, and user group, ensuring that all users can safely and effectively operate the device.

This section outlines the required content for Information to Be Supplied by the Manufacturer, as mandated under Annex II, Section 2 of MDR 2017/745, and offers practical guidance to help manufacturers ensure compliance and usability.

## Labeling

- All labels applied directly to the device, its primary and secondary packaging, and any sterile packaging.
- The label must include the following, where applicable:
    - Name or trade name of the device.
    - UDI carrier.
    - Manufacturer’s name, registered trade name, or registered trademark, and the address of its registered place of business.
    - Authorized representative’s name and address (for non-EU manufacturers).
    - Indication that the device is a medical device (MD symbol or text).
    - Intended purpose, user, and patient population (if not clear from the device itself).
    - Warnings or precautions.
    - Storage and handling conditions.
    - Any special operating instructions.
    - Expiration or “use-by” date, if applicable.
    - Batch code or serial number for traceability.

*Practical Tip:* Ensure labels remain legible under all expected storage, transport, and usage conditions. Test label durability during product development.

## Instructions for Use (IFU)

- Clear, easy-to-understand instructions covering:
    - Intended purpose and intended users.
    - Description of the device, including accessories.
    - Installation, preparation, and maintenance instructions.
    - How to use the device safely and effectively.
    - Residual risks, contraindications, and side effects.
    - Information on any necessary training.
    - Warnings, precautions, and limitations.
    - Expected lifetime of the device.
    - Explanation of symbols used on labels.

*Practical Tip:* Use simple language and visual elements, especially for devices intended for non-professional users. Conduct usability testing to confirm clarity.

## Electronic and Digital Formats

- Information may be provided electronically where appropriate, but essential safety information must also be available in physical form if required for safe use.

*Practical Tip:* Ensure electronic formats are accessible across different platforms and devices. Pay attention to long-term availability, including data archiving obligations.

---

## Languages

- The information supplied must be available in the official language(s) of the member state where the device is made available.

*Practical Tip:* Use professional translators familiar with medical terminology to ensure accurate and legally compliant translations.

---

## Alignment with Risk and Intended Purpose

- The content and format of the supplied information must reflect the device’s risk class, intended users (professional or lay users), and the intended use environment.

*Practical Tip:* Adjust detail levels and presentation style based on user group (e.g., professionals versus patients) to balance thoroughness with usability.

## Common Challenges and Tips

- **Maintaining consistency across materials:** Ensure all supplied information (labels, IFU, electronic content) is aligned and reflects the latest approved version of the device.
- **Avoiding overly technical language:** Tailor content to the target audience. Professional users can handle technical detail; lay users require simpler language.
- **Managing translations:** Inaccurate translations lead to regulatory risk and user confusion. Implement structured review processes for each language version.
- **Updates and changes:** Establish a controlled process for updating supplied information when device changes impact safety or performance.
- **Ensuring traceability:** Link every supplied document to the corresponding device version and UDI to ensure clear documentation during audits or inspections.
