# Technical Documentation - Verification and Validation Information (Annex II, Section 6)

The Verification and Validation Information section is a critical part of the technical documentation required under MDR 2017/745. It demonstrates that the device meets its intended purpose, performs as specified, and complies with applicable General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR) through comprehensive testing, evaluation, and clinical data.

This section outlines the required content for Verification and Validation Information, as mandated under Annex II, Section 6 of MDR 2017/745, and provides additional practical guidance to help manufacturers address common challenges and ensure thorough and compliant documentation.

## General Verification and Validation Requirements

Verification and validation (V&V) activities must provide objective evidence that the device:
- Fulfills its design specifications and intended purpose.
- Meets the applicable General Safety and Performance Requirements (Annex I).
- Functions consistently under expected conditions of use.

Documentation must show that V&V activities cover:
- Design verification (confirming design outputs meet design inputs).
- Design validation (confirming the final device meets user needs and intended uses).
- Process validation where necessary (ensuring manufacturing processes produce consistent products).

All V&V documentation must clearly trace back to specific design requirements and risk control measures.

## Pre-clinical Testing

Pre-clinical testing includes all non-clinical performance, safety, and reliability testing conducted to demonstrate device conformity.

This includes, where applicable:
- Mechanical and functional testing.
- Electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility testing (IEC 60601 series).
- Biocompatibility testing (ISO 10993 series).
- Sterility validation and packaging validation.
- Shelf-life and stability testing.
- Transport and environmental testing.

Test protocols, methods, results, and conclusions must be documented in detail, with clear linkage to design and risk management documentation.

## Clinical Evaluation

The clinical evaluation (in accordance with **Annex XIV**) plays a central role in validation, demonstrating that:
- The device achieves its intended purpose.
- The clinical benefits outweigh any residual risks.
- Performance and safety claims are supported by sufficient clinical data.

The clinical evaluation report (CER) must:
- Be based on relevant clinical data.
- Include evidence from equivalent devices if applicable.
- Be updated regularly based on post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF).

The CER must be consistent with the risk management file and labeling claims.

## Usability and Human Factors

For devices interacting directly with users or patients, usability validation must confirm that:
- Intended users can safely and effectively use the device under intended conditions.
- Potential use errors have been identified and minimized.

Usability engineering should follow standards like **IEC 62366**, and results should be integrated into risk management and design validation documentation.

## Software Verification and Validation

For devices incorporating software, comprehensive software verification and validation must demonstrate:
- The software meets specified requirements under all intended operating conditions.
- Software risk control measures are effective.
- The software lifecycle processes align with **IEC 62304**.

Documentation must include:
- Software requirements and architecture documentation.
- Software test plans, test reports, and traceability to design requirements.
- Verification of cybersecurity controls.

## Common Challenges and Considerations

- **Maintaining clear traceability**: Verification and validation activities must be traceable to specific design inputs, risk controls, and intended uses. Fragmented or disconnected documentation creates serious issues during conformity assessments.

- **Inadequate testing coverage**: Every identified risk, design feature, and performance claim should be covered by appropriate V&V activities. Gaps between design requirements and test coverage are common audit findings.

- **Alignment with risk management**: V&V processes must link directly to risk management outputs. This ensures that all risk control measures, especially those addressing critical or high-risk aspects, have been fully validated.

- **Clinical evaluation integration**: The clinical evaluation must fully support safety and performance claims made elsewhere in the documentation. Inconsistent performance claims across the V&V documentation, labeling, and CER often trigger major nonconformities.

- **Usability validation challenges**: Particularly for devices intended for lay users, usability testing must reflect real-world usage conditions, including factors such as environmental stress, different user training levels, and potential misuse scenarios.

- **Software lifecycle alignment**: For software devices, regulators expect full lifecycle documentation, including evidence of validation at each lifecycle stage. Missing or incomplete software verification and validation records are common findings in software device audits.

- **Linking post-market data to validation**: V&V does not end with product release. Post-market surveillance data must be regularly reviewed to determine if additional validation activities are required due to new risks or performance findings.
