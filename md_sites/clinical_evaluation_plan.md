# Clinical Evaluation Plan under MDR Annex XIV

The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 mandates that manufacturers establish a clinical evaluation plan as part of their conformity assessment. This plan defines the methodology for collecting and analyzing clinical data to demonstrate that the device meets the General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR) of Annex I.

The clinical evaluation plan is an essential part of the device’s technical documentation and must be maintained throughout the device’s lifecycle.

## Regulatory Basis for the Clinical Evaluation Plan

The **requirement for a clinical evaluation plan** is outlined in **MDR Annex XIV, Part A, Section 1**, which states:

> *"The clinical evaluation shall be based on a clinical evaluation plan, which shall be part of the technical documentation."*

Additionally, **Article 61 of MDR 2017/745** requires that the plan supports the overall clinical evaluation process, ensuring that the manufacturer:

- Identifies **clinical data sources** required to demonstrate safety and performance.
- Defines **criteria for evaluating clinical benefit and risk**.
- Establishes methods for conducting a **risk-benefit analysis**.
- Plans for **post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF)** where necessary.

## Objectives of the Clinical Evaluation Plan

The main objectives of the clinical evaluation plan are to:

- **Define a structured approach** for gathering and assessing clinical data.
- **Ensure compliance** with MDR requirements regarding clinical evaluation.
- **Demonstrate conformity** with the General Safety and Performance Requirements (Annex I).
- **Establish criteria** for identifying relevant clinical data sources.
- **Outline the risk-benefit assessment methodology** to support regulatory approvals.
- **Ensure continuous updates** through post-market surveillance and PMCF.

The clinical evaluation plan must be proportionate to the device’s risk class, considering factors such as intended purpose, mode of action, and available clinical data.

## Key Elements of the Clinical Evaluation Plan

The clinical evaluation plan should include the following elements:

### **1. Device Description and Intended Purpose**
- A clear definition of the medical device, its intended use, and indications.
- Identification of device variants and accessories.
- Clinical claims related to safety, performance, and clinical benefits.

### **2. Identification of Relevant Clinical Data**
- Literature review of existing clinical data.
- Use of data from equivalent devices (if applicable, must meet MDR equivalence criteria).
- Need for clinical investigations (if existing data is insufficient).

### **3. Methodology for Clinical Data Evaluation**
- Criteria for assessing the quality and relevance of data sources.
- Methods for evaluating clinical performance and safety.
- Process for weighing benefits against risks.

### **4. Risk-Benefit Analysis Approach**
- Identification of potential risks and mitigations.
- Justification of residual risks through clinical evidence.
- Link to risk management (ISO 14971).

### **5. Plan for Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF)**
- When and how PMCF is required based on the device’s risk class.
- Methods for collecting real-world clinical data.
- Continuous assessment of long-term safety and performance.

### **6. Clinical Evaluation Report Linkage**
- The clinical evaluation plan must define how data will be reported in the Clinical Evaluation Report.
- The Clinical Evaluation Report must provide conclusions based on data collected per the plan.

## Integration with Other Regulatory Requirements

The clinical evaluation plan must align with:

### **1. Risk Management (ISO 14971)**
- The risk-benefit analysis must be based on clinical data.
- Any new risks identified must be addressed in the risk management file.

### **2. Post-Market Surveillance (MDR Annex III)**
- The plan must define how PMS and PMCF data contribute to clinical evaluation updates.
- If new risks or safety concerns arise, the clinical evaluation must be revised accordingly.

### **3. Technical Documentation (Annex II & III)**
- The Clinical Evaluation Report must be consistent with the plan.
- The plan must be structured to meet notified body expectations.
