# Unique Device Identification (UDI) and EUDAMED Registration under MDR

The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 introduces a Unique Device Identification (UDI) to improve traceability, post-market surveillance, and patient safety. Manufacturers must assign a UDI to their devices and register them in EUDAMED, the European database for medical devices, as required by MDR Article 27.

This page outlines the UDI system, EUDAMED registration process, and compliance requirements under MDR, ensuring manufacturers understand regulatory obligations and post-market responsibilities.

## Regulatory Basis for UDI and EUDAMED

Under **MDR Article 27**, all medical devices must be assigned a **Unique Device Identification (UDI)** to:
- Improve **device traceability** across the supply chain.
- Support **post-market surveillance and vigilance reporting**.
- Reduce **counterfeit medical devices** on the EU market.
- Improve **incident reporting and recall efficiency**.

The UDI must be registered in EUDAMED, the European database for medical devices, as outlined in *MDR Articles 28-30.

## Structure of the UDI System

The UDI system consists of three key elements:

### **1. UDI-DI (Device Identifier)**
- A static code that identifies a specific device model or version.
- Assigned by a recognized **UDI issuing entity**.
- Must appear on the **device label, packaging, and EUDAMED registration**.

### **2. UDI-PI (Production Identifier)**
- A dynamic code that provides production-specific information.
- Includes data such as serial number, lot number, manufacturing date, expiration date.

### **3. Basic UDI-DI**
- A higher-level identifier that groups devices with the same intended purpose, risk class, and essential design.
- Mandatory for all regulatory submissions, including:
  - Technical documentation
  - Notified Body certificates
  - EUDAMED registration
- Not printed on labels or packaging.

## UDI Assignment and Direct Marking

### **UDI Issuing Entities**
Manufacturers must obtain UDIs from an **EU-designated UDI issuing entity**, such as:
- **GS1**
- **HIBCC (Health Industry Business Communications Council)**
- **ICCBBA (International Council for Commonality in Blood Banking Automation)**
- **IFA (Informationsstelle für Arzneispezialitäten GmbH)**

### **Direct Marking Requirements**
Reusable medical devices that undergo reprocessing before reuse must have a permanent UDI marking (engraving, laser marking, etc.), except in cases where:
- The marking is technically impossible.
- The marking would compromise device safety or performance (e.g., sterilization concerns).
- Exemptions apply as per MDR Annex VI, Part C, Section 4.10.

## EUDAMED Registration Process

EUDAMED is the EU-wide database for medical devices, ensuring transparency and regulatory oversight. Manufacturers, authorized representatives, and importers must register in EUDAMED and maintain device data.

### **Steps for EUDAMED Registration**
1. **Register as an Economic Operator (Actor Registration Module)**
   - All manufacturers, authorized representatives, and importers must register in EUDAMED.
   - A **Single Registration Number (SRN)** is assigned.

2. **Submit UDI and Device Data (UDI/Device Registration Module)**
   - Enter UDI-DI, Basic UDI-DI, and product details.
   - Assign device risk class and intended purpose.

3. **Link Conformity Assessment Data**
   - Attach conformity assessment details from the **Declaration of Conformity** and Notified Body certificates (if applicable).

4. **Maintain and Update Device Information**
   - UDI data must be actively maintained.
   - Any product changes (new versions, discontinuations) must be reflected in EUDAMED.
   - Periodic updates are required even if no changes occur.

## UDI and Market Surveillance

The UDI system is critical for post-market surveillance (PMS) and recalls:
- Competent authorities use UDI data for traceability and vigilance reporting.
- UDI supports field safety corrective actions.
- UDI ensures efficient tracking during recall*.

Manufacturers must integrate UDI data into their **PMS and risk management systems**.
